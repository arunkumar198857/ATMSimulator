# ATMSimulator

ATMSimulator is a JavaFX project created to simulate the workings of ATM Machines. In this project, I have used 
Java 12.0.1. As the backend database, I've used MySQL database and for connectivity i've used JDBC. The SQL file 
contains the sql table that is used in this project.

Following functionalities are implemented in this simulator:

1. Checking existing account.
2. New account generation.
3. Depositing money.
4. Acknowlefgement after depositing money.
5. Withdrawing money.
6. Acknowledgement after withdrawing money.
7. Checking current balance.
8. Checking account status.
9. Alert boxes for handling abnormal events.
10. MySQL Database connectivity using JDBC.


In coming future i will be adding the following functionalities:

1. Changing ATM Pin.
2. Improving Overall UI.
